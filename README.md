# Social Network API with MongoDB and Mongoose

## Description

This is the back end of a social network site that allows the creation of users, the creation of user thoughts, reactions to user thoughts, and 'connections' between users in the form of "friends." It shows the beginning server side functioning of what could evolve into a larger social networking site, complete with more complex interactions and with a front end as well, of course. It allowed me to practice developing back end systems that utilize MongoDB and Mongoose specifically, something I had not worked with before.
